# Basys3 MIDI Controller
We design a Music Synthesizer that generates the sound of a pipe organ
from a keyboard using the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) protocol. MIDI is a
serial communication protocol that outputs a series of bits that convey status, velocity, and
value information about a musical note on a digital instrument. We developed a MIDI
receiver, pipe organ waveform generator, and SPI transmitter. The project was designed in
Vivado and implemented on a Basys 3 FPGA.
